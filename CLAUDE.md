 Below are the updates and guidelines to follow:

1. Overall Page Design
White should be the primary background color for the overall site to keep it clean and elegant.

The attached color palette can be used for accents, headers, footers, buttons, and highlight sections to create a cohesive brand identity.

2. Header and Footer
All pages should have the same header and footer color to ensure consistency.

Recommended colors: FOREST (#3c4b33) or EARTH (#000000) for a strong, luxury base.

Keep the header minimal with the brand logo and navigation links.

Footer should include the logo, quick links, and social media icons in a clean, structured layout.

3. Chic Luxury Aesthetic
The design should feel minimal, spacious, and refined with elegant typography.

Use plenty of white space and balanced sections to make the site breathe and give it a high-end feel.

Pair a modern, sleek sans-serif font for headers with a light serif or clean sans-serif for body text for contrast and sophistication.

Subtle animations (like a fade-in or smooth hover effect) can be used to enhance the luxury vibe.

4. Buttons
No white buttons. White blends too much into the overall page and doesn’t stand out.

Use the brand palette for button backgrounds with contrasting text:

Examples:

FOREST background (#3c4b33) with MIST text (#eeeced)

SUNFLOWER background (#e9c770) with EARTH text (#000000)

FERN background (#6f8d5e) with MIST text (#eeeced)

Hover effect: Buttons should darken or lighten slightly within the same color range for a subtle, polished interaction.

5. Design Direction
Background: White base with sections accented in colors from the palette (e.g., MIST for content blocks, PEACHTREE for callout sections).

Images: Use high-quality, professional images with a slightly desaturated tone to fit the natural, elegant theme.

Layout: Clean, grid-based structure to keep everything aligned and balanced.

Buttons: Rounded or pill-shaped to soften the look and add a modern touch
